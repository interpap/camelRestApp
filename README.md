# CAMEL REST Microservice (Java+Camel+Spring+Maven)

This is a REST Microservice, used for listing the languages used by the 100 trending public repos on GitHub.
For every language listedðŸ‘‡:

	-- Number of repos using this language
	-- The list of repos using the language

## Get 100 Trending Repos from Github using Github API v3

Fetching trending repositories simply translates to fetching the most starred repos created in the last 30 days ( from now ). To do that, you'll need to call the following endpoint:

```
https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:>{date}&sort=stars&order=desc&per_page=100
```

The JSON data from Github will be paginated (you'll receive around 100 repos per JSON page). You can ignore the subsequent pages since you only need the first 100 repositories.

## How do I run this example?

This project can be built with

```
mvn clean install
```
